Version dev

==== **Bug Fixes:** ====


==== **General:** ====

* targetting should now be less restrictive, allowing the player to target closer to a mobs head, instead of feet
* root effects now simply apply a very strong slow rather than teleporting the player.
* slows now reduce jump height so players can not exploit spamming jump to ignore slows

==== **API:** ====


==== **Skills:** ====

* Enchant
** allows reagent requirement for enchanting - amount is still static
