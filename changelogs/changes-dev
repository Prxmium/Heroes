Version dev

	Fixed issue with bukkit permissions not being set if Permissions3 wasn't detected
	Player's displaynames will be updated properly when they choose a new path or reset.
	Player HP is now ceiled when synced preventing high HP classes from dying before they actually hit 0 HP.
	creatures added in 1.8 will no longer crash the effect system

	Skills are now loaded on Demand (only if a class has them)
